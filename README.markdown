# Distributed Companies

This is a list of companies that use distributed teams.
Please add your company or companies you know about via pull request or just
tweet me the info at @fuzzleonard and I will add it for you.

## Metrics

Two metrics for gauging the efficacy of a remote work environment are:

* Do managers (at least some of them) usually work from home? Having managers
who primarily work at home is a good indicator that the remote work
environment will be inclusive and that effective communication between
leadership and remote workers is transpiring.

* Are managers required to work near a physical office? This is a good
indicator of the level of company commitment to distributed teams as
well as chances of promotion. A remote job is nice but not being able to
advance unless you move across the country really makes it just a job; some
people would prefer to have a remote career.

There are plenty of other metrics we could use, but after a decade of working
remote I feel everything else can be seen as falling out of these two
culture-level metrics. In other words if you have the right culture all the
other things are implementation details that can be reasonably expected to
change to better serve that culture.

## Q&A

Q: Why managers specifically?

A: My experience has been if the culture supports off-site managers that
generally means there is a real remote culture with transparent group
communication. If managers mostly work on-site then cliques develop and things
happen in face-to-face meetings and after work in bars and such from which
remote employees are excluded. It can also be an indicator that upper
management is really just tolerating this whole remote employee thing because
they have to and given a chance would shut it all down.
